# Common Applications

## Learning Objectives

Familiarity with common Linux applications, including:

* Internet applications: browsers, email programs
* Office productivity Suites: LibreOffice
* Developer tools: compilers, debuggers
* Multimedia applications for audio and video
* Graphics editors: GIMP and other utilities

## Internet Applications

### Web Browsers

### Email Applications

Most email clients use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or the older Post Office Protocol (POP) to access emails stored on a remote mail server

### Productivity and Development Applications

### Office Applications

LibreOffice, evolved from OpenOffice, started in 2010 and is the most mature, widely used, and actively developed office suite for Linux.

### LibreOffice Components

* Writer: Word Processing
* Calc: Spreadsheets
* Impress: Presentations
* Draw: Create and edit graphics and diagrams

LibreOffice apps can read and write non-native document formats such as those used by Microsoft Office.
Usually fidelity is maintained when writing to these formats, but complicated documents may have some imperfect conversions.

### Development Applications

Linux distros come with a complete set off applications and tools that are needed by those developing both user applications and the kernel itself.

These tools are tightly integrated and include:

* Advanced text editors customized for programmers' needs, such as vi and emacs
* Compilers (such as gcc for C and C++) for a wide array of programming languages
* Debuggers such as gdb and various graphical front ends to it, and other debugging tools such as valgrind
* Performance measuring and monitoring programs - some with easy to use GUIs, others more arcane and only for use by experienced engineers.
* Complete IDEs such as IntelliJ, which put all these tools together.

On Linux these tools are available at no cost through standard package installation systems.

## Multimedia Applications

### Sound Players

* Amarok, Audacity, Rhythmbox for desktop music collections
* Spotify, etc. apps for streaming music services


### Movie Players

* VLC, MPLayer, Xine, Totem

### Movie Editors

* Cinepaint: frame-by-frame retouching and editing individual images in a video
* Blender: 3D animation and design. A professional tool with complex and powerful controls for modeling, camera capture, recording, editing, and enhancing.
* Cinelerra: Capture, compose and edit video/audio
* FFmpeg: Record, convert, and stram audio/video. FFmpeg is a format converter, among other tools such as ffplay and ffserver.


## Graphics Editors and Utilities

### GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)

GIMP is a feature-rich image retouching and end editing tool similar to Adobe Photoshop and is available on all Linux distros.
GIMP supports all image file formats, can provide extensive information about the image, such as layers, channels, and histograms, and supports many special-purpose plugins and filters.

### Graphics Utilities

* EOG (Eye of Gnome): image viewer with slideshow capability and limited editing tools such as rotate and resize.
* Inkscape: image editor with capabilities to work with layers and transformations of images, sometimes compared to Adobe Illustrator
* convert: command line tool, part of the ImageMagick set of apps, that convert image files in various ways: blur, resize, despeckle, convert format, etc.
* Scribus: What You See Is What You GET (WYSIWIG) tool for document creation, editing, and publishing.
