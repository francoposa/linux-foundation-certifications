# Common Applications

## Learning Objectives

Familiarity with common Linux applications, including:

* Internet applications: browsers, email programs
* Office productivity Suites: LibreOffice
* Developer tools: compilers, debuggers
* Multimedia applications for audio and video
* Graphics editors: GIMP and other utilities

## Internet Applications

### Web Browsers

### Email Applications

Most email clients use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or the older Post Office Protocol (POP) to access emails stored on a remote mail server

### Productivity and Development Applications

### Office Applications

LibreOffice, evolved from OpenOffice, started in 2010 and is the most mature, widely used, and actively developed office suite for Linux.

### LibreOffice Components

* Writer: Word Processing
* Calc: Spreadsheets
* Impress: Presentations
* Draw: Create and edit graphics and diagrams

LibreOffice apps can read and write non-native document formats such as those used by Microsoft Office.
Usually fidelity is maintained when writing to these formats, but complicated documents may have some imperfect conversions.

### Development Applications

Linux distros come with a complete set off applications and tools that are needed by those developing both user applications and the kernel itself.

These tools are tightly integrated and include:

* Advanced text editors customized for programmers' needs, such as vi and emacs
* Compilers (such as gcc for C and C++) for a wide array of programming languages
* Debuggers such as gdb and various graphical front ends to it, and other debugging tools such as valgrind
* Performance measuring and monitoring programs - some with easy to use GUIs, others more arcane and only for use by experienced engineers.
