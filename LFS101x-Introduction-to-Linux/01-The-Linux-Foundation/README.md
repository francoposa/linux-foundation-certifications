# The Linux Foundation

## Learning Objectives

* Discuss the role of the Linux Foundation
* Appreciate learning opportunities of Linux Foundation training program
* Describe software environment required for this course
* Describe the three major Linux distribution families

## The Linux Foundation

### About the Linux Foundation

The foundation partners with top companies and developers to accelerate open tech development and adoption.
Its mission is to provide expertise and tools to scale open source projects:

* security best practices
* governance
* operations & ecosystem development
* training & certification
* licensing
* promotion

The foundation is home to Linux creator Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman, as well as the Linux kernel itself and many other open software projects, such as Node.js and the Open Container Initiative.

### The Linux Foundation Events

The foundation hosts conferences and other events worldwide to:

* provide open forum for the next kernel release
* bring together devs and sysadmins to work on problems
* host workgroups and community groups for active discussions
* connect end users, sysadmins, and devs to grow enterprise Linux use
* encourage collaboration across the community

## The Linux Foundation Training

### The Linux Foundation Training

The foundation offers classroom, online, onsite, and event-based trainings.

### Training That Builds Skills

The trainings are by and for the community.
The System Adminstration courses focus on enterprise Linux environments, targeting sysadmins, tech support, and architects.
The Developer courses feature instructors and content from the leaders of the open source dev community.

Trainings are distribution-flexible.

## Course Linux Requirements

### Course Software Requirements

You need to have at least one Linux distro installed.

We will focus on the three major distribution families:

* Red Hat: CentOS, Fedora
* SUSE: openSUSE
* Debian: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint


### The Red Hat Family
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) heads the family that includes CentOS, Fedora, and Oracle Linux.

Fedora has a close relationship with RHEL and has significantly more software than Red Hat's enterprise version.
Fedora has a large community including contributors outside of Red Hat, and is used as a testing platform for RHEL releases.

CentOS is (was) free to the end user and has a longer relase cycle than Fedora.
The core of CentOS is virtually identical to RHEL.

Package mangers: yum and dnf (RPM-based)

### The SUSE Family

SUSE has SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) and openSUSE, the enterprise-support and free community versions similar to RHEL and CentOS/Fedora.
SLES is upstream from openSUSE.

Package manager: Zypper (RPM-based)

Other: YAST - Yet Another Setup Tool.

### The Debian Family
Debian is upstream for several other distributions, including Ubuntu, which is upstream for many others.
Debian is a pure open-source community project with a strong emphasis on stability.
Debian provides by far the largest and most complete software repository of any distro.

Ubuntu aims at providing a compromise between long-term stability and ease of use.
Ubuntu gets most of its packages from Debian's stable branch.

Package manager: apt (DPKG-based)
