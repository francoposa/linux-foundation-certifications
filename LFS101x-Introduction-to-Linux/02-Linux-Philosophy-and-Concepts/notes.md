## Linux History

### Introduction

Linux is an open source computer operating system.
Originally developed for Intel x86 personal computers, it has been ported to hundreds of other architectures and hardware platforms.

### Linux History

Linus Torvalds started writing Linux as a student in Helsinki, Finland in 1991.
In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the General Public License (GPL) by GNU, a project of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
Combining the Linux kernel with other system components from the GNU project, developers were able to create many complete systems called Linux distributions by the mid-90s.

### More About Linux History

The Linux distributions created in the mid-90s provided the bases for fully free (in freedom, no zero-cost) computing and became a driving force in the open source software movement.
In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced support for the Linux platform and began their own major Linux development efforts.

## Linux Philosphy

### Linux Philosphy

Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system.
Linux was written to be a free and open source system to be used in place of UNIX.
At the time, UNIX was expensive and only ran on more powerful computers.

Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, a tree branching out from the top root node, denoted by "/".
Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that behave like files.
Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files.

Linux is a multitasking, multiuser operating system with built-in networking and service processes, known as "daemons" in the UNIX world.

## Linux Distributions

### Linux Distributions

The kernel is the core of the operating system.
A full Linux distro consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.
Each tool is often its own separate project with its own developers.

Linux distros differ in how recent of a kernel version they offer.
Some distros are quicker to incorporate new kernel versions, while others move more slowly with a focus on stability, often while still backporting important kernel improvements to older versions.

Other essentials tools provided by distros include the c/c++ compiler, the gdb debugger, the core system libraries, the interfaces for drawing graphics on screen, the higher-level desktop environment, and the system for installing and updating components.

### Services Associated with Distributions

The many Linux distros cater to many different needs and interests.
Large organizations such as companies and government institutions tend to choose the major commercially-supported distros from Red Hat, SUSE, and Canonical.

Commercial distributors provide long-term fee-based support for their distributions, as well as hardware and software certifications.
All major distros offer update services to make security patches, bug fixes, and performance enhancements available to users.
