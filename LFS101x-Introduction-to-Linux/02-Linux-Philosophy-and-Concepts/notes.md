## Linux History

### Introduction

Linux is an open source computer operating system.
Originally developed for Intel x86 personal computers, it has been ported to hundreds of other achitectures and hardware platforms.

### Linux History

Linus Torvalds started writing Linux as a student in Helsinki, Finland in 1991.
In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the General Public License (GPL) by GNU, a project of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
Combining the Linux kernel with other system components from the GNU project, developers were able to create many complete systems called Linux distributions by the mid-90s.

### More About Linux History

The Linux distributions created in the mid-90s provided the bases for fully free (in freedom, no zero-cost) computing and became a driving force in the open source software movement.
In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced support for the Linux platform and began their own major Linux development efforts.

## Linux Philosphy

### Linux Philosphy

Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system.
Linux was written to be a free and open source system to be used in place of UNIX.
At the time, UNIX was expensive and only ran on more powerful computers.

Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, a tree branching out from the top root node, denoted by "/".
Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that behave like files.
Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects and can often be worked with using the same utilites used for regular files.

Linux is a multitasking, multiuser operating system with built-in networking and service processes, known as "daemons" in the UNIX world.
